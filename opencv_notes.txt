                                    ##### Read, Display and Save Image #####


img = cv.imread('tiger.jpg') - to read an image and store it in a variable.

NOTE:- The value stored in the variable after reading image is in NumPy array form.

NOTE:- img = cv.imread('tiger.jpg', 0) - stores image in gray-scale format. If 1 is placed, it stores the original image.

cv.imshow("window_name", variable_containing_image) - to show/diaplay the image.
e.g. cv.imshow("Image", img)

cv.waitKey(milliseconds) - to display the image for this much time.

cv.waitKey(0)
cv.destroyAllWindows() - to display the image window until any key is pressed and it closes.


cv.imwrite("image_filename", variable_containing_image) - to save an image
e.g. cv.imwrite("new_img.jpg", img)



                                    ##### Pixels, Resolution #####


Expressed as width X height.

Common resolutions - Full HD(1920 x 1080), 2K(2560x1440), 4K HD Ultra(3840x2160), 8K(7680x4320).

Resolution = No. of Pixels = Width * Height

Binary Image(BLACK & WHITE) - each pixel have only two possible values, Black(0) or White(1). [No shades of gray or intermediate values]. Number of bits required to represent each pixel is 1 Bit.

NOTE:- In OpenCV, Binary Image is a Grayscale Image where each pixel have only two values - Black(0) or White(255). Number of bits required to represent each pixel is 8 Bits.

Grayscale Image - intensity of each pixel determines it's brightness value. Each pixel have values that lie in the range(0-255), representing various shades of gray.

Color Image - Each pixel containsintensity values of RGB color channels, and the combination produces the final color of the pixel. Each color channel is represented by an 8-bit value(0-255). Common color depths include 24-Bits(8-Bits per color channel).
